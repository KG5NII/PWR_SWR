Here are some resources for the the Color TFT Touchscreen Power / SWR Meter project:

The reference design of the project:

https://sites.google.com/site/lofturj/power-and-swr-meter---rev

This is the site you can snag the software from.  This is the site that describes the project, it's features and it's operation. So it is the first place to start.

This group is run by Johan Holstein PD0LEW who is located in Netherlands. Johan is someone good to know if you need to know the technical details about ham related electronics. RadioStuff is a good online resource for anyone thinking about building the power meter. Johan has a number of other projects that are of interest as well. In particular the RadioBerry.

What's all this KG5NII stuff anyhow?

That's me.  Amateur radio callsign KG5NII.  Given the two websites described previously, What do you need me for?  Well you don't actually.  The two resources given above contains more than enough information to get you started building your own Color TFT Touchscreen Power/SWR meter!  All I'm doing is organizing and documenting my particular build of the meter. My particular set of PCB's will have complete BOM's as well as Gerbers and Kicad project files. (I did mention the PCB's are designed using Kicad didn't I?)  What I offer is organization in amongst some of the chaos. And if you like what you see, it will be a place you can download the PCB Gerbers to have your own PCB's made, and hopefully along the way learn a thing or two from the info in the repository.  

NOTE:  I am not an engineer.  I am not a professional anything.
